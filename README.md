# Mari0: Special Edition

My take on **Mari0: SE** since it's abandoned.

Maurice's original code is is in the [first commit](https://github.com/tzvetkoff/mari0_se/commit/399ecd76af3fbea53bab94c4ff0b5a899069e354).

Everything after that are hacks/changes/fixes.

I'm retaining the original license file and all original credits to Maurice/other developers.

For more information about it, please read the [original anouncement](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=4004).

Beta 9 was originally found [here](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=4004&start=900).

## Changes

- LÃ–VE updated to 11.5.
- A bigger and better icon. [Source](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/super-mario-icons-by-ph03nyx.html).
- World `5-3` fixed.
- Fireball gravity fixed.
- Flying Koopas fixed.

## Additions

3 new cheats:

- Always have fire power
- Never shrink if hit
- Never die (unless you fall in the pit or time's up)

## Future plans

- [ ] Fix any outstanding bugs in the game/editor
- [ ] Optimize the rendering performance as far as possible
- [ ] Reorganize/refactor the code to make it easier to understand and modify in the future
